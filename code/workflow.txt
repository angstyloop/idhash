[x] Get a test set of images using the applescript/javascript google chrome 
searcher.

[x] Count the images.

[x] Generate numbered files.

[x] Generate duplicates/ and non-duplicates/. These are directories containing
pairs of images. Each pair will be classified as a duplicate or a 
non-duplicate, based on the idhash_distance between the two images, and
a threshold that we will tune by picking the "perfect classifier" point
on a Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC).

[] Run idhash_directory on duplicates/ and non-duplicates/.

[] Create an roc_source from the .dat file that idhash_directory makes.

[] Use the roc_source to make a plotfile for gnuplot.

[] Compute the optimal threshold for IDHash as a duplicate / non-duplicate
classifier.

[] Plot the ROC with gnuplot.

[] TeX the things

[] Containerize the shee

Done!
