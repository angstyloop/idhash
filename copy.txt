- make receiving operator characteristic (ROC) curve for idhash 
  duplicate/non-duplicate classifier
  - get an image set S
  - make a set of duplicate image pairs dup(S)
  - make a set of non-duplicate image pairs dif(S)

  - apply idhash-distance to each pair. write each value to a file.

  - determine range of idhash-distance over S

    - find the interval containing R = idhash(dup(S)) U idhash(dif((S)))

  - for each possible threshold value in R:
    - classify each pair over the range of thresholds
    - mark true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives
    - compute the true positive rate and the true negative rate

  - to get ROC curve, make 2-d plot of 
    - false positive rate (FPR) on x-axis, and 
    - true positive rate (TPR) on y-axis 

- find the point closest to (0, 1), a perfect classifier. the threshold value
  corresponding to that point is considered optimal for the data
